\chapter*{Foreword}

This thesis is written by Alf Magnus Stålesen and Bjørn Dølvik. It is written as a completion to the Computer Science master at NTNU: Norwegian University of Science and Technology. The master focuses on agile retrospectives and their relation to organizational learning. 

This thesis was written in the spring of 2015, under the guidance of our supervisor Torgeir Dingsøyr. We also had an advisor in Nils Brede Moe. Both Dingsøyr and Moe were invaluable in the writing of this thesis and provided constant guidance and advice that were of enormous benefit. 

Further, we wish to thank all participants of the studies we performed. 

Also we want to thank the staff SINTEF Trondheim, for providing us with offices. Also they proved to be invaluable discussion partners during countless coffee breaks.

Finally we wish to thank our study group who have met almost weekly during the whole semester, and provided us with countless ideas and inspirations.
