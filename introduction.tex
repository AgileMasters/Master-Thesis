\section{Organizational Learning}
Organizational learning is in simple terms how an organization is able to acquire, store and utilize knowledge existing within an organization. In a more academic setting we can use Argyris and Schön definition \cite{Argyris1996} for organizational learning: 

\begin{quote}
	``Organizational learning occurs when individuals within an organization experience a problematic situation and inquire into it on the organization's behalf. They experience a surprising mismatch between expected and actual results of action and respond to that mismatch through a process of thought and further action that leads them to modify their images of organization or their understandings of organizational phenomena and to restructure their activities so as to bring outcomes and expectation into line, thereby changing organizational theory-in-use. In order to become organizational, the learning that results from organizational inquiry must become embedded in the images of organization held in its members' minds and/or in the epistemological artifacts (the maps, memories, and programs) embedded in the organizational environment. ''
\end{quote}

Organizational learning can be applied to groups of people over different sizes. One can use it to analyze huge organizations consisting of many actors in different roles, or small groups of people working close together. For this research we are going to apply the organizational learning at an agile development team. 

Different types of frameworks exist for organizational learning. Levitt and March uses a framework that see learning in organizations as encoding inferences from history into routines that guide behavior \cite{Levitt1988}. The retrospective is a process of shared learning for an agile development team learning from the last iteration of development. Investigating learning using this framework won't yield much as the retrospective already is seen as a collective learning activity \cite{Dingsoyr2004}. 

Argyris and Schön \cite{Argyris1996} uses two different models to determine how an organization learns through individuals, Model I and Model II. As agile teams often are limited to a close group of individuals we will apply Argyris and Schön's models. To understand these models we first need to investigate two types of learning: Single-loop learning and double-loop learning. Further in this section we will explain these types of learning as well as Model I and Model II. We will also look at Triple-loop learning as it is the concept of learning about learning. 

\subsection{Single-loop}
Single-loop learning is a type of learning defined by Argyris and Schön. It consist of a single-feedback loop that finds an error and a way to fix this problem. Argyris and Schön \cite{Argyris1996} defines single-loop as: 

\begin{quote}
``By single-loop learning we mean instrumental learning that changes strategies of action or assumptions underlying strategies in ways that leave the value of a theory of action unchanged.

... In such learning episodes, a single feed-back loop, mediated by organizational inquiry, connects detected error - that is, an outcome of action mismatched to expectations and, therefore, surprising - to organizational strategies of action and their underlying assumptions. These strategies of action and their underlying assumptions. These strategies or assumptions are modified, in turn, to keep organizational performance within the range set by existing organizational value and norms. The values and norms themselves ... remain unchanged. 
''
\end{quote}

An example of single-loop learning from software development could be finding a bug, find a solution to fix it and the fix it. The single-loop learning would here be learning the solution and fixing the bug. We have provided a basic illustration of single-loop learning in \autoref{figure:single-loop}.

	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth, keepaspectratio]{figures/Single-loop.png}
	\caption{Single-loop learning.}
	\label{figure:single-loop}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Double-loop} % (fold)
\label{sub:double_loop}
Double-loop learning is a type of learning where one ask whether the underlying factors that influence the actions and results is sufficient.
One might say that one understand the root-cause for the issue. 
Argyris and Schön defines double-loop learning as: 

\begin{quote}
``By double-loop learning, we mean learning that results in a change in the values of theory-in-use, as well as in its strategies and assumptions. The double loop refers to the two feedback loop that connect the observed effects of actions with startegies and values server by strategies. Strategies and assumptions may change concurrently with, or as a consequence of, change in values. Double-loop learning may be carried out by individuals, when their inquiry leads to change in the values of their theories-in-use or by organizations, when indivduals inquire on behalf of an organization in such a way as to lead to change in the values of organization theory-in-use. ''
\end{quote}

This type of learning can be shown in our bug example. If the developers who earlier found and fixed a bug did a root-cause analysis on the issue they could get several results indicating that underlying factors are not sufficient for the current state of development team. One underlying factor could be weak specification description requiring the team to rethink and restructure how they develop specifications. Another reason could be that the knowledge for the system are not good enough with the developers indicating a knowledge-gap in the team and considerations for the state of the team may be required. 

For this research we use the term double-loop learning when the influences for the issue is understood and change occurs as a results of this. A simple figure of double-loop learning can be seen in \autoref{figure:double-loop}

\begin{figure}[!h]

\subsection{Model I} % (fold)
\label{sub:model_i}
Argyris and Schön \cite{Argyris1996} describes a learning system called Organizational learning I, which theory-in-use is described as Model I. As organizational learning I is employed learning system that can be defined by different actions and implementations we will instead go into the theory-in-use, Model I, as these systems employ them.

Argyris and Schön \cite{Argyris1996} describes Model I through its governing variables. We will go through each of them along with the actions strategies, consequences for behavioral world and consequences for learning, effectiveness that follows of the different governing variables that actors try to satisfy. 

The first governing value described is defining goals and try to achieve them. This leads to the action strategies of designing and manage the environment unilaterally. The behavioral consequences are that the actor gets seen as defensive, inconsistent, incongruent, controlling, fearful of being vulnerable, withholding feelings, overly concerned about self and others, or under-concerned about others. For the effectiveness and learning the consequences are that the actor are self-sealing and the longterm effectiveness is decreased. 

Maximize winning and minimize losing is the second governing variable that the actors in an organization try to satisfy. The actions strategies for this governing value is that the actor takes ownership and control of a task. This results in a defensive interpersonal and group relationship where the actor wants the rest of the group to see things his way and little help could be a result of this. For terms of learning this will provide single-loop learning as the output of the task his more important than the task itself. 

The third governing value for the actors in this kind of learning model is minimizing generating or expressing negative feelings. The action strategy that follows is that the actors wishes to protect themselves using defensive actions such as blaming, stereotyping and suppressing feelings. The consequences for the behavioral world is defensive norms within the organizations. Rivalry, lack of external commitment and mistrust are examples of such norms. For the learning consequences of this value little theories will be tested publicly prohibiting double-loop learning in the organization. However there will still be much testing of theories with the individuals however this knowledge will not reach the organization. 

Being rational is the fourth and final governing variable for Argyris and Schön's Model I theory-in-use for the learning organization. Being rational provides the action strategy of protecting other from being hurt resulting in actions like withholding information, creating censoring rules that can censor information and behavior. This returns the same consequences for the behavioral world, learning and effectiveness as described above. 

Through the governing values of Model I the actors within the organization prohibits double-loop learning. The organization creates a win or loose situation between the actors leading to withholding of information, mistrust between the actors and little testing of current norms of values. This again provides competition instead of collaboration and thus have a negative impact on the learning and effectiveness of the organization. Model I is further described by Argyris and Schön as the different elements of the model interact in complex ways. This can be read about in ``Organizational learning II: Theory, Method and Practice'' \cite{Argyris1996}.

\subsection{Triple-loop} % (fold)
\label{sub:triplloop}
The term tripleloop learning has been used in different ways as highlighted by Tosey, Visser and Saunders \cite{Tosey2011}. Triple-loop learning can be referred to both triple-loop learning and deutoro-learning. For this work we are going to stick with triple-loop learning. Tosey, Visser and Saunders performed a critical review of the triple-loop learning concept and finds that three concepts have been widely used in academic literature. 

The first concept they investigate is a form for learning above double-loop learning that addresses some learning in a level above the governing variable of double-loop learning. Tosey et. al. finds that this concept seem to be poorly defined, imprecise and unfounded in the way it is used. 

The second concept describes triple-loop learning as a form for meta-learning, a form of learning not above single-loop and double-loop, but rather beside. Learning about learning is a simple description. Tosey et. al. Finds that this concept is a renaming of deutoro-learning and raises the question if this renaming is needed. 

The final concept connects triple-loop learning to Bateson's Learning III, which can be read about in ``Gregory Bateson on deutero-learning and double bind: A brief conceptual history'' by Visser \cite{Visser2003}. This concept relates to a type of learning that is non-instrumental and exists beyond language. Tosey et. al. finds that the literature that uses this concept have not been conducting a comprehensive working-through of Bateson's Theory. 

For our research we are going to use the second concept, where triple-loop learning is regarded as a kind of meta-learning. We define triple-loop learning as the learning about learning, where one organization are able to understand the learning processes occurring within the company and learn from these. A simple figure is provided in \autoref{figure:triple-loop}.

As an example of triple-loop learning we again turn to the bug example used earlier. After understanding both how to solve the bug and the influences which made the bug occur, the development team can investigate their learning process, by for an example retracing their steps from noticing the issue until they have understood the influences which made the bug occur. Along the way they may be able to learn how to investigate future problems or change the way they already learn through their given processes.

\section{Shared Mental Models}

The theory of shared mental models is from cognitive psychology, and can be used as a lens to evaluate agile development and methodology as described by Petter et al\cite{Petter2013}. The concept is that a team has a shared mental model that is central to the mutual understanding between team members, and thus essential to project success. Without a good shared mental model a team is left with a poor understanding of the task at hand, as well as barriers for cooperation. Two metrics used to measure a team's shared mental model are ``similarity'' and ``accuracy''. Where ``similarity'' is the degree which the shared mental model is similar between team members, and ``accuracy'' is the degree which the shared mental model matches objective measures. 

\subsection{The stages of Shared Mental Model generating}

	
Four different stages of building shared mental models are identified \cite{Petter2013}. These are knowing, learning, understanding and executing. An overview of these stages is seen in  \autoref{table:stages-mental-model}. Knowing is the stage where a team gets exposed to information relating to their project and project goals, at this stage team members are encouraged to share information between each other. The second stage is the learning stage, this stage consists processing the information gained in the knowing stage. The understanding stage is defined by reaching consensus and understanding the team member's individual views. Executing is the last stage, with a developed shared understanding the team is able to reach goal, at this stage a team responds to a situation based on the work done in the previous stages.

\end{tabular}
\end{centering}
\end{table}

	
\subsection{Shared Mental Models and retrospectives}

Petter et. al. \cite{Petter2013} describe multiple agile development practices, but do not focus a lot on the agile retrospective. In the appendix of the article they give the following link between retrospectives and shared mental models.

\begin{quote}
Enhances the development of learning and understanding stages by facilitating the information sharing and integration. This practice also improves the teams’ executing capability in the next sprint
\end{quote}

The shared mental model practices that are involved in the retrospective are identified as self corrective, training and reflectivity. We discuss this phenomenon more in \todo[inline]{Link til discussion del om SMM og Retro}
