\section{Pilot study}

In this section we will describe a pilot study that was done in the start of the thesis. The pilot study was conducted in order to investigate the potential of analysing a set of 77 retrospective reports. The reports were acquired through an advisor, Nils Brede Moe. The reports stretched from 17.08.2009 to 15.12.2014. The reports were from DNV. The pilot study was limited to 11 reports, where we picked every 7th retrospective chronologically. This distribution was chosen in order to get an even spread to represent the whole set, as well as keep the size managable for the  short preliminary study.
