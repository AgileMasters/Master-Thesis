\subsection{Governing Values}
Argyris and Schön\cite{Argyris1996} described several governing values for learning organizations as we described in \autoref{intro:organizational-learning}. Throughout this section we will reflect on our results using these governing values investigating how retrospectives is performing as a learning practice. 

In Model I, described in \autoref{sub:model_i}, four governing values set the focus for the learning organization. Into our investigation of the retrospective practice we have seen very little to any of these values. 

One could argue that the team setting goals and achieving them could be compared to creating actions and fulfilling them, however we do not support this as the fulfillment of actions is part of a collective efficiency improvement and learning practice. The retrospective and its participants are instead of trying to design and manage the environment unilaterally, investigating all the different angles and perspective the team can present and finding solutions to the problems existing within that environment. The joint team discussion and retrospective practices are evidence of this. 

Maximizing winning and minimizing loosing is not visual in the current retrospective practice. The teams are not afraid to use the retrospective as an arena for creating experiments on new practices where some might work and some might not. Team Delta and Echo, gave examples where the teams had tried to implement new practices and instead of going down with ship when the practice had not worked, leave ship and try something else. In Team Delta things that did not work for the members of the team simply did not get done and it was a joint understanding that actions that did not get any attention were bad practices. In Team Echo the team was not satisfied with current work practices and changed them drastically. After some months time they found that these new practices only made thing worse and instead of claiming ownership for the task and try to force it through the team decided to try something new. 

Through retrospectives we have seen that the participants are allowed to express their feelings regardless of their good or bad. This effectively counter the third governing value which is minimizing generating or expressing negative feelings. Team Echo and Delta both described events that showed participants raising negative issues and feelings towards the team. From the retrospective analysis for Team Zulu we saw that 89.3\% of the actions created came from negative issues. Even though allowing negative feelings are good thing some of the interview subjects said it could become a little bit to much negative sometimes, and that the retrospective is not a arena to vent. As was the case with Team Zulu the third and fourth feedback session revealed that the team had become more aware of raising also good feelings and issues during the retrospective and such they felt the retrospective had improved. This indicates that allowing negative feelings is important as one can learn and improve from them. However one should also ensure that good feelings are raised as they also provides the same opportunities and creates a more enthusiastic feeling about the retrospective.

As feelings are encouraged to share during the retrospective, to some moderation, the fourth governing value being rational also seemed to not be the apparent in the retrospective. Being rational implies censoring feelings and as we described above retrospectives encourages sharing of feelings towards the group. 

The consequences resulting from Model I governing values also seems to be rarely encountered in retrospectives in terms of the behavior. We have witnessed one case where an actor acted defensibly and such created an atmosphere that suppressed the other participants feelings. Creating what was described in an elephant in the room. It was also confirmed by the interviews that personnel issues were not addressed during the retrospective and such events could decrease the value gained from the retrospective. Other than this we have neither seen or heard about teams having defensive norms, or having defensive interpersonal relationships. 

Most of the learning consequences seems to be opposite of what is expected by Model I except single-loop learning and possibly decreased long-term effectiveness. It might not be that surprising that as the governing values are rarely encountered that the consequences of them is not either. Neither self-sealing, lack of public testing of theory or too much testing of theory in private seems to be appearing in teams conducting retrospectives. What is more surprising is that single-loop is quite occurring. We will dwell deeper into this in \autoref{discussion:learning-types}. In terms of decreased effectiveness we have no way compare these to any of our results as we lack a control group applying most of the governing values from Model I. 

The governing values from Argyris and Schön's Model I seems to not occur or be the system employed by agile development teams performing retrospective systems today. We have only seen two cases where the governing values of Model I has had any implications on the team. The first one was that of face-saving from one of the team members resulting in an atmosphere suppressing the other members feelings. This member later left the team. The other implications of Model I governing values is that of single-loop learning which most teams experience and will be discussed further in \autoref{discussion:learning-types}

The governing values of Argyris and Schön's Model II are more apparent in the teams that practice retrospectives. 

Valid information is the first of the governing values of Model II and the retrospective practice require information gathering from the team members. We have seen several ways that retrospective teams gathered information. Nominal brainstorming through KJ-session, around the table discussion and others techniques have all been used to gather information and finding issues with the development process. Zedtwitz\cite{Zedtwitz2002} found memory bias as one of the barriers to learning and Bjarnason and Regnell\cite{Bjarnason2012} proposed evidence based timelines as a technique to counter this. None of the teams we investigated used this technique and none of them mentioned memory bias being a problem for the retrospective. Neither did we see this through our content analysis of Team Zulu. However during the feedback sessions with team Zulu looking back at specific events happening a year past the team was uncertain. This gives us reason to believe that in terms of iteration retrospective which happen regularly with a timespan of weeks don't suffer from memory bias. However feature driven retrospectives and project retrospectives could suffer from this. 

To identify the issues we have seen that the practitioners of retrospectives uses only information gathered from the participants with one exception of a team using lead times as a measurement tool. However we have not seen many examples on using other information tools to evaluate solutions for issues than the participants of the meeting. We have seen team Zulu and team Foxtrot postponing issues until they can investigate it further. This have not come up in our discussions with other teams, but it can seem that the teams during retrospectives acquire knowledge when their own is lacking.

The second governing value of Model II is free and informed choice and through our study we have seen that teams are mostly free to make their own improvements through the retrospective. Many firms have adopted agile methodologies and an important part of it is having short feedback loops and thus the retrospective can be a valuable practice. None of the teams spoke of problems with management having too little time or being allowed to conduct retrospective. This effectively eliminates Zedtwitz\cite{Zedtwitz2002} barrier of managerial time-constraints. The second managerial barrier of bureaucratic overhead is also for most cases absent from the retrospective practice. Teams are free to conduct the retrospectives in any matter they themselves chooses. The only cases where the barrier provide any impediments is cases where implementing an action has a high resource cost which we learned form Team Alfa. Also issues that required change with external parties could hinder implementation as we learned form Team Zulu. Other than that we seen that all the teams are free to conduct and manage their own retrospective practice, providing an environment of free and informed choice for the team. 

The third and final governing value of Argyris and Schön's Model II for organizational learning is internal commitment to the choice and constant monitoring of its implementation. This value is one of the challenges facing retrospectives today. All the teams in the study emphasized that getting things done and actually see the actions followed through was crucial to having a valuable retrospective. If the team could not see any choices become implemented this would create a negative feedback loop where participants enthusiasm would lower and the chance of new actions being implemented would decrease even further. However as we have seen in our content analysis only 19\% of the actions created was still left unresolved. Most of the other teams we interviewed seemed pleased with the action implementation. That most teams acknowledged the risk of not implementing actions reveals that teams have a focus towards maintaining the issue. 

Enforcing process improvements was admitted as a challenge by some of the teams and thus reveals that implementation of actions could prove difficult. Considering all the input we got on the subject push-tactics, assigning responsible individual, worked better than pull-tactic where it was expected that some would handle the implementation. This reveals a lack of commitment and aligns well with Drury et. al. \cite{Drury2012} findings that daily operational tasks triumphs that of strategic/tactical tasks found during the retrospective. The interviews revealed that enabling the team-members to acquire an ownership towards the work process improved the commitment to the retrospective and implementation of tasks. Some teams also added retrospective actions as a part of backlog to increase the implementation rate.
