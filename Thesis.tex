Agile retrospectives could help team learn from the past and identify improvement opportunities. In this thesis we investigate the characteristics of the present retrospective practice and the organizational learning it provides for teams practicing them, through a multiple case-study. 

The research is based on a depth-study of five years of retrospective practice from one team, and a breadth-study of seven interviews from other retrospective practicing teams. 

Our results shows that teams today are mostly satisfied with their retrospective practice and are able to identify improvement opportunities and implement them, which contradicts previous research\cite{Drury2012}. However we identify one barrier related to team commitment dependent on enthusiasm and previous implementation of improvement opportunities that results in a feedback-loop that could both help implement future improvements and hinder it. We investigate the learning happening through todays retrospectives and finds that the practice is approximating an Organization Learning II system \cite{Argyris1996}, with most of the governing values and behavioral consequences is present in todays practice. However we find that the primary learning type remains single-loop even though double-loop should be expected. We identify a barrier that hinders double-loop learning consisting of several factors and propose a method based on our findings that can lower this barrier. 

Finally we conclude that today's retrospective practices provide agile development teams to adapt their current work-practices and enables them to learn from past development iterations and thus provide the means for identifying improvements opportunities and improve from them.
